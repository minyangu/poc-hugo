The app will link with your favourite social networks and quickly redirect you to different sites to perform the social tasks required. </p>\n<p>The current list of estimated rewards per campaign ranges from $1 to $5000. Although some rewards are pretty high, users should keep in mind that often, the valuation of these tokens has no real market base. </p>\n<p>Additionally users should consider creating new social media accounts to protect their privacy and avoid any link between their wallet addresses and their real identity.<br /></p>\n<h2>Predictions</h2>\n<h3>Cindicator</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.cindicator.com/?_branch_match_id=613307534266789858\">Cindicator</a> is a predictive analytics platform that uses machine learning and collective intelligence, from over 130 thousand analysts, to forecast the outcome of stock and crypto markets. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Cindicator-Free-BTC-Update.png\" alt=\"Cindicator Questions\" title=\"Cindicator Questions\" /><figcaption>An example of the questions waiting to be answered</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Anyone can become a Cindicator analyst by signing up and answering different questions listed on the platform. The questions include estimating the likeliness of an asset to be traded above or below a certain price, or the highest and lowest price an asset will be traded in a specific time period, as to calculate the support and resistance levels through crowd intelligence. </p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Ciindcator-2-Free-BTC-Update.png\" alt=\"Cindicator Forecast\" title=\"Cindicator Forecast\" /><figcaption>Answer correctly to get rewarded</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For each successful forecast, analysts get rewarded with points, which, in addition to the echelon they belong to, is used to calculate their claim to the 1.25 BTC pool for Crypto forecasts and $7500 for the Stock forecasts. The rewards are converted into CND tokens and distributed to the lucky winners, who can withdraw their balance from 150 CND or 0.01 ETH. </p>\n<p>Additionally, the analysts topping the monthly leaderboard get free access to the analytics platform and its multiple features, to further benefit their portfolio with informed decisions. </p>\n<h2>Video-games</h2>\n<h3>Vibe or Die</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://betanet.vibehub.io/browse/show/5b909b9460bf9e00143ec999\">Vibe or Die</a> is a FPS shooter game that allows players to wager and get rewarded for every kill they make. </p>\n<p>To start, new users will need a Metamask account to fund their account and withdraw the tokens they earn. Here is a short <a href=\"https://medium.com/@VIBEHUBNEWS/complete-tutorial-guide-for-vibe-or-die-3240d68888e6\">Medium</a> tutorial on how to set up your account.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Vibe-or-Die-Free-BTC-Update.jpg\" alt=\"Vibe or Die\" title=\"Vibe or Die\" /><figcaption>A higher death count = a higher balance</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Players can select the following tokens and the stakes to wager on from the game menu: </p>\n<p>VIBE stakes: 0.1 ~ 10 ~ 100 ~ 10,000 per kill/death</p>\n<p>BNB stakes: 0.01 ~ 0.1 ~ 1 ~ 10 per kill/death </p>\n<p>ETH stakes: 0.01 ~ 0.1 ~ 0.5 ~ 1 per kill/death</p>\n<p>The game itself is pretty straightforward: there are no character classes or different weapons to pick up in different parts of the arena. Instead, all players fight with the same type of weapon and grenades with infinite ammunition and health that regenerates overtime.</p>\n<p>Like most blockchain based games, all the transactions and kills/deaths during Vibe or Die gameplay are available to users through the VIBENet private chain explorer.</p>\n<h3>Updated on 03/05/19</h3>\n<h2>Passive interest: earn free crypto easily</h2>\n<p>If big risks and gains are not really your cup of tea, earning interest on your capital through a crypto lending platform is probably the safest option. That is, right after keeping your funds in your own wallet. </p>\n<h3>BlockFi</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/BlockFi-Earn-Free-Crypto.png\" alt=\"BlockFi's Crypto Interest Account\" title=\"BlockFi's Crypto Interest Account\" /><figcaption>Get interest on your crypto at BlockFi</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Backed by renowned partners such as Coinbase Ventures, Galaxy Digital, CMT Digital, Consensys, and other big names, <a href=\"https://blockfi.com/\">BlockFi´s</a> platform offers crypto collateralized loans with a Loan to Value of 50% (borrow 3000 USD, deposit 6000 USD worth of BTC or ETH). As well as getting a loan; users can also become lenders, earning a very decent 6.2% monthly compounded annual interest. </p>\n<p>Your BlockFI funds will be safely stored with Gemini, a New York-based custodian. Considering the custodian charges 0.4% annual interest for custody services to new customers; BlockiFi seems like a pretty good deal. </p>\n<p>A key point is that the business doesn't limit the scope of its loans, providing for those traveling around the world, buying stocks, paying off credit cards, business loans or even buying new cars. There is always the chance of borrowers not paying back their loans, but as the loans are collateralized there is no default risk. </p>\n<h3>Celsius</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Celsius-Update_190503_132026.png\" alt=\"Celsius Network\" title=\"Celsius Network\" /><figcaption>Grow your balance with Celsius</figcaption></figure>\n<p>From Alex Mashinsky, one of the inventors of VOIP (Voice over IP), comes <a href=\"https://celsiusnetwork.app.link/Luigie8db\">Celsius Network</a> - the technology that has made internet phone calls a reality.</p>\n<p>Unlike BlockFi, Celsius lenders can withdraw their funds anytime they want as interest is calculated daily and paid weekly. The business also offers 16 currencies to earn interest on the top cryptocurrencies and stable coins; with annual interest ranging from 3% to 7% on the deposited currency.</p>\n<p>Rest assured, your deposits to Celsius are kept safe by Bitgo, one of the leading cryptocurrency custodial services.</p>\n<p>Another difference with BlockFi is that Celsius loans are mainly focused on institutional lending, although it also lends out to individuals for a bigger interest than BlockFI.</p>\n<h2>Crypto Cashback</h2>\n<h3>Crypto.com (cashback &amp; rebate on Airbnb &amp; Expedia)</h3>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Crypto.com-Earn-Free-Crypto.png\" alt=\"Crypto.com's Universal Wallet\" title=\"Crypto.com's Universal Wallet\" /><figcaption>Crypto.com presents the wallet &amp; card app that you've always wanted</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Considered as one of the most ambitious upcoming projects, this <a href=\"https://crypto.com/en/index.html\">mobile multi wallet and payment app</a> includes bank transfers, Crypto Tracking features, upcoming collateralised credit loans and an automated investment tool</p>\n<p>Additionally, by purchasing and locking / staking a determinate amount of their native currency - the MCO token (0.6 USD on May 2017 ICO, currently 3.42 USD) - for 6 months, users will receive different types of MCO VISA cards (the cheapest one being completely free).</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Crypto.com-2-Earn-Free-Crypto.png\" alt=\"Crypto.com rewards\" title=\"Crypto.com rewards\" /><figcaption>The MCO token perks </figcaption></figure>\n<p>Crypto.com offers 1% to 5% cashback (paid on MCO), on ALL spending, free international withdrawals, 100% cashback on Spotify &amp; Netflix subscriptions, 10% cashback on Airbnb and Expedia, and also 10-25% referral rewards.</p>\n<p>Even though the app is already live and the MCO token price increased significantly instead of losing 90% of its value, like so many ICO tokens, the bad news is that the MCO Visa cards will be available “soon”, and are not currently available in the US or in Europe yet.</p>\n<h2>Free Bitcoin Faucets</h2>\n<h3>Febbit</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://febbit.com/?ref=5c9cd718c2e2ca0001e361e4\">Febbit</a> is a faucet-like browser game that awards satoshis for having the player’s avatar “mine” in-game currencies and booster items. Players can “mine” for items every hour and improve their efficiency and idle time by buying boosters.</p>\n<p>“Mining” to get a decent bag of satoshis takes quite some time, considering the minimum withdrawal amount is 1000 satoshis.</p>\n<p>Rest assured, as stated in their FAQs, Febbit <strong>doesn’t use any of your computer resources for mining.</strong></p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Febbit-Earn-Free-Crypto.png\" alt=\"Febbit\" title=\"Febbit\" /></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Febbit-2-Earn-Free-Crypto.png\" alt=\"Febbit\" title=\"Febbit\" /><figcaption>Earn BTC the fun way with Febbit</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Cointiply</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://cointiply.com/r/JezDV\">Cointiply</a> is one of the slickest faucets we have seen so far. The site rewards users with coins which are tied to the US dollar (100 coins = $0.01 = 0.000002 BTC).</p>\n<p>Users can claim between 15 and 840 coins every hour by rolling the dice and testing their luck.</p>\n<p>Once users have more than 10 coins, they can choose to gamble on the Multiplier game for the chance to increase their bags.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Contiply users get rewarded for completing surveys, viewing a large selection of ads and playing free mini games.</p>\n<p>The platform also offers 5% annual interest for users that have a balance of over 35,000 coins and have opted in. Users can also deposit BTC in order to reach the minimum amount required for earning interest. </p>\n<p>Unlike many other faucet sites, they do offer direct withdrawals from 100,000 coins or 35,000 through third-party sites.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Cointiply-Earn-Free-Crypto.png\" alt=\"Cointiply Dashboard\" title=\"Cointiply Dashboard\" /><figcaption>How much will you win?</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>Crypto Mining</h2>\n<h3>Honeyminer</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://honeyminer.com/referred/594bt\">Honeyminer</a> aims to be the easiest way to mine cryptocurrencies and earn bitcoin for anyone with a computer. The Honeyminer platform allows its users to take advantage of their unused computational power by mining different cryptocurrencies and getting rewarded for it in Bitcoin.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Honeyminer-Earn-Free-Crypto.png\" alt=\"Honeyminer Mining Platform\" title=\"Honeyminer Mining Platform\" /><figcaption>Earn with Honeyminer</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The process is fairly easy, users download the Honey Miner program, set up an account with their email address and you are ready to mine. </p>\n<p>The profitability of the mining will depend on the performance of the computer and the amount of time the program is allowed to mine. </p>\n<p>Turning the mining function on and off is as easy as clicking a single button. While mining, the amount of resources being used doesn’t really affect most of the user’s tasks with the exception of intensive gaming or video editing. </p>\n<p>Honeyminer’s program is available on Windows and will soon be available on Mac. The company also features a mobile app which allows users to monitor the mining of the computer or computers remotely.</p>\n<p>Like any other investment in the Crypto-scene, you should be looking at it with a long term perspective: the platform’s current withdrawal fee is 0.00037500 BTC while the minimum transaction size is 0.00002500 BTC.</p>\n<p>*Cryptocurrency Mining is a highly competitive sector and prospective miners should consider Cloudmining or miner hosting services as the most scalable and lucrative alternatives.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Updated on 28/03/19</h3>\n<p>Stellar, the 10th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is investing big-time in educating and expanding the whole crypto ecosystem. In ground-breaking partnerships with two of the heaviest hitters in the industry - Blockchain.com and Coinbase - they aim to bring crypto to the masses. Read on for the specifics on how to get some free money.</p>\n<h2>Earn free crypto</h2>\n<p>The simplest way to get your hands on crypto today is arguably by <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/bitcoin-101/8437-how-to-buy-bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">buying it</a>, but there are plenty of sites that will net you some <strong>crypto for free</strong> for you to try before you buy, or to simply grow your portfolio. In this article, we'll keep an updated selection of the <strong>best sites to earn free crypto</strong>, or to grow your crypto holdings<strong>.</strong> </p>\n<p>Back in the old days of cryptocurrency, one could <strong>earn bitcoin easy</strong> by watching ads or simply clicking on a button every determined amount of time. As a matter of fact, multiple crypto evangelists/influencers got their first bitcoin or a decent fraction of it that way. These pioneers were called <strong>bitcoin faucets</strong>, and even though most of the early ones are no longer active, nowadays there are many new ways to <strong>easily earn cryptocurrency</strong>. <br /></p>\n<p>We have scoured the web for opportunities for you to <strong>grow your crypto savings</strong>, from small amounts to big bounties. And with Cloudbet's new lowest minimum bets at <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/promotions/12454-bet-small-dream-big-the-lowest-bitcoin-betting-stakes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">only 10 Satoshi</a>, even the smallest proceeds can turn into big amounts. So, without further ado, here are the <strong>top ways to earn free crypto</strong>, divided by category.</p>\n<h2>What are Faucets?</h2>\n<p>The first <strong>bitcoin Faucet</strong> was launched in 2010 by Gavin Andersen, the so-called <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/527051/the-man-who-really-built-bitcoin/\">\"Satoshi Nakamoto successor\"</a> and chief developer of the open source code that defines the rules of bitcoin - AKA <strong>bitcoin core</strong>. The faucet site was closed down in 2012 but in its early days have rewards of up to 5 BTC to each visitor. What was worth only a few cents at the time could have turned into $100 thousand during the late 2017 all-time high. That is, if you managed to keep your bag safe and untouched for seven whole years.</p>\n<h3>Yobit exchange</h3>\n<p>Fast forward to 2019 and we find a wide range of bitcoin and altcoin faucets that pay significantly less than 5 BTC. <a href=\"https://yobit.io/en/\">Yobit</a> is not one of the leading exchanges on Coinmarketcap, but it has close to 500 trading pairs and a few additional features, including - you guessed it - a faucet. </p>\n<p>Yobit’s faucet offers the highest reward-per-effort ratio as there is no over complicated task and users only need to pass one Captcha to claim all the altcoin rewards. While this faucet doesn't reward in bitcoin, the minimum trading orders allow users to exchange their altcoin rewards for their preferred cryptocurrency. </p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n <tbody><tr>\n <th class=\"tg-kia7\">Criterion</th>\n <th class=\"tg-c32u\">Rating</th>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-lkj2\">Ease of use</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Reward value</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Our verdict</td><td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2>What are Airdrops?</h2>\n<p>An Airdrop is a process by which the developers of a token-based project distribute their own currency for free, sometimes under certain conditions. The coins or tokens are delivered to wallet holders that have a determinate balance or that have registered their interest on the project </p>\n<p>In some cases, getting rewarded with the coin or token of a particular project will require a bit more work than just providing your public wallet address. Some of the projects will require users to do basic social tasks like following, liking and commenting on the project on Telegram, Twitter, Facebook or even Linkedin. The most complicated airdrops we have seen over the past year required passing a full KYC procedure, downloading their native wallet, writing articles or even making a video on one’s thoughts about the project.</p>\n<p>While it may seem counterintuitive at first, Airdrops have been an effective method to raise awareness and interest of a project; which is the whole point of a pre-ICO campaign.</p>\n<h3>Blockchain.com's Stellar airdrop</h3>\n<p>While this has been going on for some time, giving away $125 million in cryptocurrency is probably not as easy as anticipated. By <a href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/getcrypto\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">signing in for a Blockchain.com wallet</a> and going though their verification process, you will be automatically credited with $25 in XLM Lumens - not bad at all for just signing up for one of the most established wallet services around. But hurry up - they are almost done with the distribution.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/blockchain.png\" alt=\"Blockchain.com's huge giveaway\" title=\"Blockchain.com's huge giveaway\" /><figcaption>Hurry and claim yours before it ends</figcaption></figure>\n<p>When coupled with Coinbase's offer, that makes an incredible <strong>free $75 in XLM</strong> right now - read on to learn more.<br /></p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n <tbody><tr>\n <th class=\"tg-kia7\">Criterion</th>\n <th class=\"tg-c32u\">Rating</th>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-lkj2\">Ease of use</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Reward value</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Our verdict</td><td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3>Airdrops.io</h3>\n<p>There is an abundance of ICO listing sites, newsletters and telegram channels to learn about the latest token Airdrop. Cloudbet’s pick is <a href=\"https://airdrops.io/\">Airdrops.io</a> as it has one of the largest lists of airdrops, categorized by channel for the tasks. The platform has an exclusive list of airdrops available to registered users and a Holders airdrop section, where top cryptocurrency holders can learn about the airdrops they are eligible for. </p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n <tbody><tr>\n <th class=\"tg-kia7\">Criterion</th>\n <th class=\"tg-c32u\">Rating</th>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-lkj2\">Ease of use</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Reward value</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Our verdict</td><td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/How-to-earn-BTC/airdrops.png\" alt=\"Airdrops.io homepage\" title=\"Airdrops.io homepage\" /><figcaption>So. Many. Airdrops</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>What is Microtasking?</h2>\n<p>An upgrade to the faucets came through <strong>microtasking</strong>, which involved more time and effort from the users in order to deliver rewards. On the flip side, rewards can be more flexible, paying more for more demanding tasks and giving some better ROI than faucets.</p>\n<h3>Stormx</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stormx.io/\">StormX</a> is a micro-tasking mobile app (Android/IOS) that rewards users for signing up for subscriptions (streaming, FinTech and other services), playing mobile games, answering surveys and trying out various apps. Around half of the offers do not require users to spend anything besides a negligible amount of time. For example, watching ads every 30 min will award you 500 bolts, per video. </p>\n<p>The mobile game Harvest Land will reward you with 262K bolts for downloading it and reaching level 15; although high-end mobile games usually reward around two million bolts, that is around 0.002 BTC.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/How-to-earn-BTC/Stormx.png\" alt=\"StormX app\" title=\"StormX app\" /></figure>\n<p>The app rewards users in “bolts” which can be exchanged for BTC and ETH (exclusively with a Coinbase wallet) or even for STORM (StormX´s currency, currently listed on exchanges like Binance).<br /></p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n <tbody><tr>\n <th class=\"tg-kia7\">Criterion</th>\n <th class=\"tg-c32u\">Rating</th>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-lkj2\">Ease of use</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Reward value</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Our verdict</td><td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3>Coinbase Earn</h3>\n<p>An alternative approach to microtasking, <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/earn\">Coinbase Earn</a> is actually rewarding its users for learning about the <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/bitcoin-101/10113-bitcoin-glossary-a-bitcoin-language-guide\">altcoins</a> listed on the exchange. The exchange has partnered up with Stellar, one of the top ten cryptocurrencies, and are offering up to an incredible <strong>$50 in XLM Lumens</strong> for going through their educational videos and learning more about the project. When coupled with Blockchain.com's offer above, you can get a whooping $75 in Stellar right now - so go get it!</p>\n<p>Apart from this new option, they have three other educational giveaways, including BAT and Zcash.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/Coinbase-Earn.png\" alt=\"Coinbase Earn platform\" title=\"Coinbase Earn platform\" /><figcaption>Earn: now with Stellar</figcaption></figure>\n\n<p>In order to receive the rewards, users will need to signup on Coinbase Earn and wait for an email invite to earn these coins. The tasks are pretty simple and consist of watching short videos on the token or coin and answering a simple quiz on the previously played video.</p>\n<table class=\"tg\"><tbody><tr>\n <th class=\"tg-kia7\">Criterion</th>\n <th class=\"tg-c32u\">Rating</th>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-lkj2\">Ease of use</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Reward value</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Our verdict</td><td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3>Buzzin</h3>\n<p>Contrary to StormX, <a href=\"https://buzzin.com/\">Buzzin</a> offers rewards exclusively on tasks related to new cryptocurrencies and services. There is a wide range of tasks including visiting a website, watching one of their videos, follow/comment on social media or even going through KYC of a particular exchange to vote on a token listing.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/How-to-earn-BTC/buzzin-hp.png\" alt=\"Buzzin Homepage\" title=\"Buzzin Homepage\" /><figcaption>Buzzin' with rewards</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Buzzin tasks are rewarded in points that can be exchanged for ETH or the native token of various developing blockchain projects.</p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n <tbody><tr>\n <th class=\"tg-kia7\">Criterion</th>\n <th class=\"tg-c32u\">Rating</th>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-lkj2\">Ease of use</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Reward value</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Our verdict</td><td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2>What are Bounties?</h2>\n<p>A type of not-so-micro tasking, but usually without the <em>micro</em> part. On the one end, someone will put a bounty against a task that they would like delivered. On the other end, bounty hunters can compete to collect the task’s pay. Some tasks are professional-like, but some others are merely to give opinions, make memes, and other small-time stuff.</p>\n<h3>Gitcoin and Bounties Network</h3>\n<p>For those with a more technical background, <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/\">Gitcoin</a> offers some pretty decent crypto pay for development work, with some design gigs popping up as well, although not as often as crushing bugs on code.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/How-to-earn-BTC/Gitcoin.png\" alt=\"Gitcoin bounties\" title=\"Gitcoin bounties\" /><figcaption>Gitcoin open bounties</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For more of the non-technical stuff, the <a href=\"https://bounties.network/\">Bounties Network</a> offer a wide range of high-value rewards for finding bugs and contributing to developing blockchain projects also on the marketing, design, content and opinion sides. \nCurrently the tasks go from a few cents worth of altcoins up to a whooping $1,000 in DAI. The more complex the issue, the bigger the reward. <br /></p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n <tbody><tr>\n <th class=\"tg-kia7\">Criterion</th>\n <th class=\"tg-c32u\">Rating</th>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-lkj2\">Ease of use</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Reward value</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Our verdict</td><td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h2>Spending fiat money</h2>\n<p>Hey - this one’s pretty easy.

For 1 Euro/month (or 1 Pound/month for UK customers), Wirex provides a debit card with a 0.5% cryptoback (cash back in BTC) without any hidden fees. Plus, you can buy the top cryptocurrencies directly using your fiat account through the Wirex app.</p>\n<figure><a href=\"https://wirexapp.com/r/10lh5yz6l3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Bitcoin-101/How-to-earn-BTC/Wirex.png\" alt=\"The Wirex App\" title=\"The Wirex App\" /></a><figcaption>Wirex App</figcaption></figure>\n<p><a href=\"https://wirexapp.com/r/10lh5yz6l3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a></p>\n<table class=\"tg\">\n <tbody><tr>\n <th class=\"tg-kia7\">Criterion</th>\n <th class=\"tg-c32u\">Rating</th>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-lkj2\">Ease of use</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Reward value</td>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n <td class=\"tg-x5q1\">Our verdict</td><td class=\"tg-x5q1\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td></tr></tbody></table>\n<h3>Purse.io</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://purse.io/\">Purse.io</a> is the frictionless link between Amazon gift card owners “Earners” looking to cash out on their gift cards, and BTC &amp; BCH holders “shoppers” looking to buy on Amazon at a discounted price.</p>\n<p>Shoppers are able to upload their Amazon wishlist, browse through a selection of items and select from a 5% discount for the optimal delivery time or over 15% if they are not in a rush. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Earners can browse through a list of shoppers requests that include the country, total basket price, discount requested and the amount of bitcoin to be rewarded.
