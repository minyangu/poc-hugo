    "body": "<p>We’ve already written about <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/in-the-cloud/12169-the-curious-case-of-crypto-in-india\">India’s complicated relationship</a> with bitcoin. Even though it’s not illegal to own, buy or sell cryptocurrencies in the country, the Reserve Bank of India has imposed a de facto ban on financial institutions dealing in virtual currencies since April 2018. The move was contested in courts and brought up to the country’s Supreme Court, but it’s been a slow mover.<br /></p>\n<p>In April 2019, a hearing was supposed to settle the matter once and for all, but the <a href=\"https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-supreme-court-new-date-crypto-case/\">decision was postponed</a> until at least July 23, after the court’s Summer break. In the meanwhile, buying and selling cryptocurrencies in local currency has been a cumbersome endeavour, as RBI’s instruction forbids banks to have any association with cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>While they still wait for a more definite solution, local operators had to get creative in order to cater to the INR market. Read on to find out how to buy bitcoin in India.</p>\n<h2>Buying bitcoin with Indian Rupees (INR)</h2>\n<p>With the RBI instruction still in place, buying BTC with Indian Rupees demanded quite some creativity from the exchanges that still manage to operate with fiat in the country. </p>\n<h3>Indian crypto exchanges</h3>\n<p>Ingeniously, the way these exchanges found to go around the de-facto banking ban is to match traders cashing in and out in a P2P system that mimics Localbitcoins. This way, the exchange avoids any connection between crypto transactions and the banking system, and deposits/withdrawals become just bank transfers between individuals.</p>\n<p>Basically, the process goes like this:</p>\n<ol><li><p>Alice wants to buy 1 BTC using her Rupees. She requests a deposit in the platform and waits for a match;</p></li><li><p>Bob has 1 BTC and wants to cash out, matching Alice’s request;</p></li><li><p>Alice transfers funds into Bob’s bank account, and both parties confirm it in the platform;</p></li><li><p>The INR amount is credited to Alice, and Bob can spend his Rupees elsewhere.</p></li></ol>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong>: buy locally, in INR, with a simple bank transfer. Trade within the platform just like any other exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong>: slow, as it can take time to match buyer and seller.</p>\n<h3>Koinex</h3>\n<p>Koinex is one of the earliest Indian exchanges, and one of the pioneers in implementing this solution. They explain the process for depositing and withdrawing in two short video tutorials:</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<h3>Pocketbits</h3>\n<p>Following suit, <a href=\"https://pocketbits.in/\">Pocketbits</a> is another innovator in the Indian crypto space, and the process to deposit and withdrawing INR is virtually the same. They explain the whole process in detail <a href=\"https://support.pocketbits.in/support/solutions/articles/44000917158-p2p-inr-deposit-and-withdrawals\">in their FAQs</a>.</p>\n<h2>Dedicated OTC marketplaces</h2>\n<p>Other global platforms offer over-the-counter trading, matching buyers and sellers through an escrow service that guarantees funds are properly transferred. </p>\n<p>The most notable example is Localbitcoins, the first such platform and a global reference in P2P trading.</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>Alternative options: <a href=\"https://otcbtc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OTCBTC</a>, <a href=\"https://wallofcoins.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WallofCoins</a>, <a href=\"https://paxful.com/\">Paxful</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bitquick.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">BitQuick</a></p>\n<h2>Buying bitcoin on international exchanges</h2>\n<p>If all else fails, you can always try to buy bitcoin through international exchanges by using a credit card or an international wire. Beware, though: going this way tends to be more expensive, and - given RBI’s position - might lead to banking problems.</p>\n<p>Some of the most time-tested ones are <a href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Coinbase</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bitfinex.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bitfinex</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kraken.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kraken</a>, <a href=\"https://cex.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CEX.io</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information, check out our <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/bitcoin-101/8437-how-to-buy-bitcoin\">comprehensive guide on how to buy bitcoin</a>.</p>\n<p>After getting your bitcoin, hurry up and join our <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/promotions/13798-turn-six-free-bets-into-100mbtc\">Cricket World Cup promotion</a>, and grow your BTC stash even more.</p>",
