The customer placed just 0.0007 BTC (possible due to our <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/promotions/12454-bet-small-dream-big-the-lowest-bitcoin-betting-stakes\">new minimum stakes limits</a>) on a variety of markets that all had odds over 2.0. </p>\n<p>This included spreads, run line and moneyline markets with the accumulator being completed due to a bet on Under 208.5 during the Toronto and Philadelphia play-off game on May 12th. The odds of the accumulator was a staggering 274/1!</p>\n<h3>Biggest payout from a single bet</h3>\n<p>The largest payout from a single bet came from Italy in Serie A.

Check out our latest odds <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/sports/usa/mlb/c18/game-lines\">here</a> and get involved in one of the most popular sports to bet on!</p>\n<h3>Most active bettors</h3>\n<p>Clay court tournaments are always a sign that the tennis season is heating up as it arrives in Europe, with a couple of Grand Slams right around the corner. Masters 1000 events in Madrid and Rome provide the perfect warm up for the top players to get ready for the French Open, whilst bettors can analyse their form before the big one. </p>\n<p>Tennis was the most popular sport in May and attracted a lot of new bettors, with our range of in-play markets proving popular throughout. The <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/betting-strategy/13731-2019-french-open-player-performance-data\">French Open</a> has started and although the winners will be crowned in June, it’s important for the top seeds such as Nadal, Djokovic, Federer and Zverev to negotiate some of the less experienced and fancied competitors.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, here are some noteworthy comebacks that paid out big. </p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Liverpool qualifying into the Champions League final</strong>, after an incredible 4-0 performance at Anfield, following 3-0 defeat in the first leg at the Nou Camp </p></li><li><p>Sticking with the Champions League, Tottenham managed to secure an incredible last minute winner to complete their comeback against Ajax. With seconds to go, Lucas Moura wrapped up his hat-trick to send the London team into dreamland</p></li><li><p>Toronto Raptors amazingly secured their first ever finals trip in the NBA, coming from behind to beat the Eastern Conference favourites Milwaukee Bucks 4-2</p></li></ul>\n<p>That’s all for May - stay tuned to the latest <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/category/previews\">sports opportunities and previews</a> here at the Cloudbet Blog, and until next month.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>April 2019 highlights</h2>\n<p>With a lot of sporting competitions coming towards their compelling conclusions, and many others only just beginning, April was a thrilling month for our bitcoin sports bettors. </p>\n<h3>Biggest accumulator odds</h3>\n<p>An incredible <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/betting-strategy/13445-what-are-parlay-bets-and-how-to-place-them\">8-match accumulator</a> was hit this month on 8 separate soccer matches. The customer placed just<strong> 0.0005 BTC </strong>(thanks to our <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/promotions/12454-bet-small-dream-big-the-lowest-bitcoin-betting-stakes\">new minimum stakes limits</a>) on eight total goals markets. On each occasion the player chose over and all of them came in, with the accumulator hitting odds of<strong> 38/1!</strong></p>\n<h3>Biggest payout from a single bet</h3>\n<p>The largest pay from a single bet came from <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/betting-strategy/10187-ultimate-baseball-betting-guide\">baseball</a>. The bet, placed on Colorado Rockies at odds of 2.47 against the Atlanta Braves netted the bettor a staggering <strong>9.33 BTC</strong> - nearly €44,000. </p>\n<h3>Most bets placed</h3>\n<p>The hotly anticipated <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/betting-strategy/12633-ipl-cricket-bitcoin-betting-strategy-guide\">Indian Premier League</a> drew in a massive amount of bets last month, with Cloudbet’s industry smashing cricket odds largely to thank. We have been offering markets with <strong>just 1% margins</strong> during the prestigious T20 tournament, using <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/betting-strategy/13323-betting-exchanges-explained\">an exchange style</a> to allow customers to trade and tactically place multiple bets on each event to make a profit. There have been 37 games during April and the group stage is almost complete, so keep an eye out for the exhilarating knockout phase in May and watch the drama unfold. </p>\n<h3>Most active bettors</h3>\n<p>April is always an exciting month for basketball fans as 16 teams begin their <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/previews/13388-nba-betting-tips-and-odds-playoffs\">play-off campaigns</a> in hope of winning the coveted NBA Championship. With 5 away victories out of 6, the Golden State v LA Clippers series consistently attracted a high number of punters. </p>\n<p>The Warriors, who are huge tournament favourites, had a couple of disappointing performances that may have given the other teams hope, particularly as center DeMarcus Cousins is now out for the rest of the season. </p>\n<p>As the Conference semifinals begin, expect the NBA hype to increase as we get ready to crown the champions in June.</p>\n<h3>Noteworthy comebacks and payouts </h3>\n<p>Last but not least, here are some noteworthy comebacks that paid out big:</p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>Ajax secured their place in the Champions League semi-finals </strong>with a 2-1 win away at Juventus, thereby ending <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/betting-strategy/9741-cristiano-ronaldo-worth-to-juventus\">Ronaldo’s</a> UCL dreams. What an incredible achievement for the Dutch side after also beating 2018 champions Real Madrid in the last 16. </p></li><li><p>The <strong>biggest upset of the month happened in snooker</strong>, as world number 1 <strong>Ronnie O’Sullivan</strong> lost to an amateur player in the World Championships. Although Ronnie was struggling with illness, this was the first time an amateur player had ever competed in the tournament, let alone beat the number one. <strong>James Cahill’s</strong> lack of experience certainly explains why not one of our bettors backed him to win, but with odds reaching a high of 23.00 prior to the match, a €10 bet on him would have pocketed you around €227. He may have secured himself a place in the snooker history books for such an unexpected win, but he’s also earned his place in ours this April for being the one that got away. </p></li></ul>\n<p>That’s all for April - stay tuned for the latest <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/category/previews\">sports opportunities and previews</a> coming up in May as you <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/sports\">enjoy bitcoin betting on sports</a> at Cloudbet this month.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>March 2019 highlights</h2>\n<p>March been dominated by basketball and soccer, as NCAA March Madness avalanches through the month and the UEFA Champions League reaches its later stages. But other sports have also brought some unexpected wins.</p>\n<h3>Biggest return from any bet</h3>\n<p>Without a doubt, this honour goes to an 8-match <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/betting-strategy/11993-mma-bitcoin-betting-guide-everything-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">multi-bet on the UFC</a>. Starting with just 0.02 BTC, the lucky player took home about <strong>1.4698 BTC</strong> - nearly €7,000 from a bet of less than €100. The bold player stacked odds of around 68/1, including 3 outsiders, in his call.</p>\n<h3>Biggest payout from a single bet</h3>\n<p>The largest pay from a single bet came from tennis. The bet, placed on Roger Federer at -1.5 sets against Isner netted the bettor 2.53 BTC - nearly €12,000. </p>\n<h3>Most bets placed</h3>\n<p>Given the sport’s popularity, the frantic nature of this particular competition, and our <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/promotions/12454-bet-small-dream-big-the-lowest-bitcoin-betting-stakes\">lowering betting limits</a> to staggering <strong>10 Satoshi</strong>, it’s no surprise that basketball took the throne here. In particular, March Madness has attracted an unprecedented number of bets placed - especially with it being part of our <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/promotions/12457-the-basketball-bitcoin-giveaway-march-madness-btc-betting\">basketball BTC giveaway</a>. Players took advantage of the lowest limits in crypto to jump all over the books.</p>\n<h3>Most active bettors</h3>\n<p>It’s hardly a surprise that the most popular sport in the world is also the one with the most active bettors here at Cloudbet. With the UEFA Champions League reaching its Quarter-Final stages, it’s only natural that to see punters go for the most competitive tournament in the world - especially <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/betting-strategy/9741-cristiano-ronaldo-worth-to-juventus\">as Ronaldo</a> and Messi made it through, and a dream final confrontation between the scoring titans still on the table. </p>\n<h3>Noteworthy comebacks with noteworthy payouts</h3>\n<p>Last but not least, here are some noteworthy comebacks that paid out big. </p>\n<ul><li><p><strong>United qualifying into the Champions League final</strong>, at odds of 20/1 - quite a feat for the club at this stage.</p></li><li><p>The biggest upset of the month happened in tennis, as Number 1 seed David Goffin lost in the Phoenix Challenger QF after being set up to Salvatore Caruso. One lucky punter managed to bet on Caruso at 18/1 at the start of the second set, banking 0.188 BTC with his call.</p></li></ul>\n<p>That’s all for March - stay tuned to the latest <a href=\"https://www.cloudbet.com/en/blog/category/previews\">sports opportunities and previews</a> here at the Cloudbet Blog, and until next month.</p>",
