However despite its simplicity, you can swiftly end up bust. This article will help you understand the nuances of Baccarat by explaining some of the strategies you could use to maintaining your bankroll through strategic bets. If you’re lucky they could even help you turn a profit. But is there a <strong>winning Baccarat strategy</strong>?</p>\n<p>The most effective long term strategy in any game is one that reduces the house edge, allowing you to manage your bankroll more effectively. Most casinos will use eight decks of cards for Baccarat in order to minimise the odds of winning. The number of decks in play alters the probabilities slightly so for simplicity, all the house edges in this article assume that eight decks are in play.</p>\n<p>Despite what you might think, Baccarat, like all casino games is based on luck rather than skill, these strategies can help to structure your play instead of betting blind. But they won’t guarantee a return. If it did, no one would share that kind of information. If you're not sure of the basics of how to play, read our article on how to play Baccarat. But if you want try different methods of playing, give these strategies a go in the Cloudbet live casino.</p>\n<h2 id=\"best-baccarat-system\">What is the best baccarat system?</h2>\n<p>Money management is critical for long term success in Baccarat. Excluding the tie bet, there isn’t much difference in the payout amounts of Banker and Player bets. They payout at evens, with a small commission taken for Banker bets. These staking strategies are all progressive systems of betting. They're popular because any losses can be covered by an eventual win. However, as with any betting system, losses can quickly mount up and they rely on having enough bankroll to continue the sequence. You can use any staking strategy you wish, but these are two of the most popular:<br /></p>\n<p><strong>1-3-2-4 system</strong></p>\n<p>The 1-3-2-4 system is a positive progression system. You always start betting one unit, if you lose, keep betting one unit. Only once you win do you bet three units. A win from that means you bet two units, a loss means going back to one unit. If you win four in a row, you’d start the sequence again but have made ten units profit. This strategy was devised to maximise returns and minimise losses in games where the main bets are around evens. Though it keeps losses to a minimum in terms of units, a continued losing run would negate any total profits gained.</p>\n<p><strong>Martingale system</strong></p>\n<p>The Martingale system is a negative progression strategy. After each loss, you’re required to double your stake. It relies on eventually winning to cover your losses and make a profit. The Martingale system sounds logical, and indeed once you win, you'll win enough to cover your previous losses. And because you're required to double your stake with every loss, the total wagered could quickly escalate to the table maximum.</p>\n<h2 id=\"best-strategy-baccarat\">What's the best strategy for baccarat? </h2>\n<p>Now you’re familiar with staking strategies that can easily be applied to Baccarat, let’s take a look at the three types of bets on the table. Many strategies will tell you to pay attention to streaks, however remember you’re playing a game of chance. Short-term streaks on player or banker bets may happen but in the long run they’ll even out with each other. Casinos will either display previous winning hands or provide you with the means to record it yourself. Remember that just because a run of hands has occurred, it doesn’t make the opposite hand more likely to appear. The player's hand will win 44.62% of the time. The banker's hand will win 45.85% of the time. Let's take a closer look at the bets you can make.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://cdn.cloudbet.com/images/Blog/Casino/Baccarat-Banker-Bet.png\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n<p><strong>Betting on Tied Hand</strong></p>\n<p>This has the highest odds but the lowest probability. Betting on the tie might seem appealing from the odds, usually 8:1, and unsurprisingly the house edge is the highest, 14.36%. But it rarely occurs. The probability for a tie in baccarat is 9.53%</p>\n<p><strong>Betting on Player’s Hand</strong></p>\n<p>Though the House Edge for player bets is 1.24% which is a substantial improvement on the tie, it’s still not the best bet to make when playing Baccarat. Though if you bet on the player’s hand and it wins, you’ll double your stake. For some players, this is a preferred outcome as you’ll win more per hand.</p>\n<p><strong>Betting on Banker’ Hand</strong></p>\n<p>In Baccarat, the house edge for banker bets is 1.06%. It’s the bet that seasoned Baccarat players always begin on and pay attention to. Casinos know this so it’s why, generally speaking, you pay 5% commission on winning banker bets. It might seem off-putting but in the long run, you’ll keep more of your bankroll. And then, for what we're looking for this would be one of the better long terms strategies for playing Baccarat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-win-baccarat\">How to win Baccarat</h2>\n<p>Like all casino games, Baccarat can seem simple at first but successful players know how to turn the odds in their favour. You don't need to count cards, you only need to know what decisions you can make to be on the winning side of the bet. And don't rely on going on a hot streak to win at Baccarat. It's incredibly rare to win more than one hand in a row, let alone more than five. So keep a handle on your bankroll. If you were to go all in on your first hand, you won't be able to handle any variance if you lose. You'll have no money to keep playing. So that begs the question, how do you win at Baccarat? Is it possible to do so consistently? Your best bet, would be to start with betting on the banker. Whether you choose to always bet on the Banker or alternate between Banker and player is your decision. But the smart money stays on the Banker.<br /></p>\n<p>So now you should understand different ways of playing the game, it’s time to put it into practice.

What are you waiting for?</p>\n<h2 id=\"answering-baccarat-questions\">Answering your baccarat questions</h2>\n<p><strong>What are the basics of playing baccarat?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two hands in this card game; the player’s and the banker’s. Before the cards are dealt, you are given the chance to bet on which of the three possible outcomes you think is most likely: the player winning, the banker winning, or a tie.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve made your decision, 2 cards are dealt: those that have a value of 10, J, Q, or K are worth nothing, an ace is worth 1 and the remaining cards worth their associated number. If the 2 cards equal more than 10, the second digit becomes the value of the hand. For example, a 6 and 5 equals 11, so the value of the hand is 1. </p>\n<p>This means that the aim of the game is to get the 2 cards to equal <strong>9. </strong>You can read more about what happens if more cards need to be dealt to either the player or the banker in our in-depth guide to playing baccarat, but essentially - if you bet on the hand that gets the closest <strong>9 </strong>and there is no tie, you win. It’s as simple as that. </p>\n<p><strong>How to get better at baccarat? </strong></p>\n<p>If you’re new to the game, the best way to get better is to practice. At Cloudbet we offer free play on a number of our table games, including baccarat, so that you can get all the experience you need before playing for real in our bitcoin casino. </p>\n<p>If you feel confident with the basics, then testing out the different systems and strategies we’ve listed above might help you gain a better understanding of the game - but It’s important to remember that at the end of the day, baccarat is based on <strong>luck</strong> and not skill. </p>\n<p><strong>What is the exact house edge in a game of baccarat? </strong></p>\n<p>The house edge is the term given to the average profit the casino venue or provider makes from your bet. In baccarat, the house edge differs depending on the outcome; for a tie it is 14.36%, for the player’s hand it is 1.24% and for the banker’s hand it is 1.06%. </p>\n<p>As mentioned above, casinos and game providers are aware of this and so add on commission to any winning banker’s bet. It’s important to keep this in mind when playing, as it means you may not always come away with as much as you expect.</p>\n<p><strong>Where can I play the new version of baccarat online? </strong></p>\n<p>Our unrivalled choice of games is one of the many reasons why our users keep coming back.
